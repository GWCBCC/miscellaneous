'''
We bookmark so many cool things in https://groups.diigo.com/group/Pythoneers, but
I forget them over time.  I wanted a way to be reminded of them occasionally, so
I can remember to use them, check that they're still live, that they're tagged
helpfully.

So I wrote this script to use http://html.python-requests.org/ to scrape the Diigo
website and email me a random old bookmark a few times a day.

I'd recommend running this in a virtual environment:
1) download Python 3.6+
2) create a folder and stick a virtualenv in it (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
3) Schedule a cron job to run the script in that environment every hour:
0 * * * * /Users/jasonblum/diigo/bin/python /Users/jasonblum/diigo/check_diigo.py

BTW, yes, I know they have an API (https://www.diigo.com/api_dev) but, after multiple
exchanges with their technical support, I could never seem to get it to work.  And anyway
python-requests makes it almost just as easy!
